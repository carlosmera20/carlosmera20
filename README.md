## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carlos, PhD in Systems Engineering and Informatics, working at Instituto TecnolÃ³gico Metropolitano de MedellÃ­n. I have almost 10 years of experience in the area of machine learning, working on applied research projects with different universities.

Whenever I have spare time, I love cooking (I have a technical degree in gastronomy) and spend some time growing orchids.
